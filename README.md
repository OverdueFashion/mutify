# Mutify
  Mutify is an extension or a peice of code that mutes 
## Why?
  * I am sick of loud ads in spotify 
  * don't have a job to afford premium :(
  * To show off my noob JS skills 
## Working
  * For loop running with an interval of 3 secs 
  * checks for the duradation if less than 30 secs mute else unmute 
  * Not reallly ad free but 1 min of silence is lot better than "Whether you're up in the clouds or going way underground, it's............."
